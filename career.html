				<h3>BRAND STORY</h3>
				<p>OMEGARENDER APPEARED ON THE ARCHVIZ MARKET AT THE END OF 2015. INITIALLY, WE WERE A LOCAL, SMALL STUDIO OF ENTHUSIASTS. WE WERE SMALL, BUT WE HAD BIG DREAMS. AND BY 2017, WE HAD GROWN IN LEAPS AND BOUNDS, AND WE TOOK OUR FIRST STEPS INTO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET.</p>
				<p>THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF OUR COMPANY IS ARTEM KUPRIYANENKO, AN ARCHITECT BY EDUCATION, AND A FORMERL 3D ARTIST. BEFORE OMEGARENDER, HE OPENED CG INCUBATOR, THE FIRST ONLINE SCHOOL FOR ARCHITECTURAL VISUALIZATION IN THE POST-SOVIET SPACE. THE SCHOOL WAS A GREAT SUCCESS AND LED TO THE RECOGNITION OF OMEGARENDER AS A PROJECT OPEN TO TALENTED ARTISTS.</p>
				<p>AFTER A WHILE, WE PROVED THAT A STUDIO IN EASTERN EUROPE COULD MEET OR EVEN SURPASS THE QUALITY OF LEADING ARCHVIZ COMPANIES AND MAKE HIGH-QUALITY PHOTOREALISTIC IMAGES FOR THE WORLD'S BEST ARCHITECTURAL AND DESIGN BUREAUS.</p>
				<p>HAVING TRAVELED THE JOURNEY FOR SEVERAL YEARS, THE COMPANY OF 3 PEOPLE GREW INTO ONE WITH 150+ EMPLOYEES AND HAS GAINED A FOOTHOLD IN THE AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN MARKET. AMONG OUR REGULAR CLIENTS ARE GENSLER, PERKINS&WILL, PERKINS EASTMAN, OBMI, ROCKWELL GROUP, NEOM, SOM, HOK.</p>
				<p>WE CLEARLY OUTLINED OUR MISSION IN 2017 — TO ACHIEVE A LEVEL OF PHOTOREALISM THAT HAS NO EQUAL IN OTHER FORMS OF IMAGES; TO BRING EVEN THE TINIEST DETAILS TO PERFECTION; TO CREATE SCENES WITH AN IDEAL AND EYE-CATCHING ATMOSPHERE.</p>
